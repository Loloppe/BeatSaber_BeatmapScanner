# BeatSaber_BeatmapScanner
This plugin display new values directly on the image cover. 

â˜† is the average difficulty of a map, calculated with T, I and M.  
T represent tech.  
I represent speed and intensity.
M represent horizontal movement and extra arms movement. 

Configuration include:
- Turning on/off the plugin
- Enabling the build-in ImageCoverExpander
- Changing colors
- Turning off the star rating limiter (not recommended)

To fix:
- Some maps with Mapping Extension still end up being analyzed for some reason (it shouldn't). Haven't really tested much, I don't use those plugins.

To do:
- Port the plugin to ChroMapper
- Make better algo in general
