# BeatSaber_BeatmapScanner
Analyze the difficulty of a beatmap

This plugin show new values for custom beatmap. <br />

â˜† is the average difficulty of a map, calculated with T, I and M.  
T is an algorithm based on cut direction and angle strain.  
I is an algorithm based on the speed of the pattern.  
M is an algorithm that compare nove placement based on cut direction  

To fix:
- Some maps with Mapping Extension still end up being analyzed for some reason (it shouldn't). Haven't really tested much, I don't use those plugins.

To do:
- Port the plugin to ChroMapper
