# BeatSaber_BeatmapScanner
Analyze the difficulty of a beatmap

This plugin will show a difficulty value at the bottom of the selected custom beatmap. <br />

The algorithm currently use:
+ Average swing distance as base
+ Average angle strain for tech
+ Average note per second for speed

TODO:

1. Handle map under X notes? Idk
2. Detect MappingExtension/NoodleExtension maps and ignore them?
