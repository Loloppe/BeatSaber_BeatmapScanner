# BeatSaber_BeatmapScanner
This plugin show new values for custom beatmap directly on the image cover.  

â˜† is the average difficulty of a map, calculated with T, I and M.  
T represent Tech.  
I represent Speed/Intensity.  
M represent extra Movement. 

Configuration include:
- Turning on/off the plugin
- Enable the build-in ImageCoverExpander
- Colors
- Turning off the star rating limiter (not recommended)

To fix:
- Some maps with Mapping Extension still end up being analyzed for some reason (it shouldn't). Haven't really tested much, I don't use those plugins.

To do:
- Port the plugin to ChroMapper
- Make better algo in general
